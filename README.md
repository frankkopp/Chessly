# Welcome to the Chessly wiki!

## Backgroud

I'm not a professional developer. It's a hobby. A hobby which started when I was 12 years old with Basic on my Commodore 116 and later Commodore 16/128/Amiga. I love challenges and to learn new things. So although much of my work would look trivial for professionals I enjoy the challenge and learning. This is also reflected in my programming. I'm not always looking for the practical or easy way - I like to learn and apply patterns and best practices, I like to keep things open for extension and changes. So whenever you find some peculiar code and think "why the hell is he doing this so complicated" it is probably because of this. Or maybe just because I was dumb and didn't know better ;) 

I started developing a game back in my university days using C++ and later Java 0.9. The game I developed then was Reversi (Othello). In 2003 I decided to start over to develop a Reversi game with Java Swing ui form scratch.

In 2013 I decided to use the Reversi base and develop a Chess engine with a UI. As I like working on the whole package - ui, engine, architecture - I did not simply use an existing ui to focus on the engine. Instead I started developing an ui and an engine. It is not my goal to build the best engine possible but I want to understand the way a good engine should work and also a good ui should work.

This is why I rewrote the ui in winter 2015/2016 to a JavaFX based ui.

And of course it is never complete, never fully documented... :)

The code described here is from my version 2 and above of my chess game **Chessly**.
